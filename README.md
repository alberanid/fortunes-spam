# fortunes-spam

Fortune cookies taken from subjects and bodies of funny or strange SPAM messages.

It's intended to be used with the [fortune](http://fortunes.cat-v.org/) Unix program.

## Notice

The text of fortunes is obfuscated using rot13, since they are mostly offensive.

## Install

Copy the files 'spam-o' and 'spam-o.dat' in one of the following directory:
 * /usr/local/share/games/fortunes/off/
 * /usr/share/games/fortunes/off/
 * /usr/local/share/games/fortunes/
 * /usr/share/games/fortunes/

or wherever your unix puts fortune files.
In Linux, if you put the files in an "/off/"(ensive) directory the fortune program will read the files only when the "-o" or "-a" option is used (for details: man fortune).

If you're interested in Italian spam, you've to copy also the files 'spam-ita-o' and 'spam-ita-o.dat'.
The charset of both files (spam-o and spam-ita-o) is UTF-8; convert it to suite your system, if needed.

## Update

If you add your own fortunes, you can also update the *.dat* files running **make** (it requires the *strfile* command, usually found in the *fortune-mod* package)

A demo bot can be found here: https://t.me/FortunesSpamBot
